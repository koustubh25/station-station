# Raw Idea

**Feature Description:**
Create a multi-part professional technical blog that highlights the use of `agent-os` to implement this product and the use of Spec Driven Development (SDD).

**Blog Structure:**
1. Brief introduction on advantages of SDD over using simple AI (Claude)
2. Purpose of the project - what we're building
3. How we used `agent-os`, specifically:
   - Creating a new product
   - Shaping the spec
   - Writing the specs
   - Writing tasks
   - Implementing tasks
4. Explanation of why we didn't use orchestrate tasks (it's for complex tasks and other fitting reasons)

**Additional Requirements:**
- Each part should not be too long
- Parts should be fairly independent but can build on previous parts
- Link GitHub repository and GitHub Pages at the end
